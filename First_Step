First thing that I will suggest you is that you need to develop a basic understanding of the data structures. 
Data structures are the platform on which you build the foundation of your program
You can never be a good programmer without getting an absolutely strond understanding of the data structures

Once you are done with the data structres. you need to start to learn about all the famous algorithms
Knowing algos are very important for builiding the skills for CP (competitive programming) 
   
Rest is practice .   
you should start practicing more and more to secure a good job in future
